               <li>1 pound (454 g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into 1-inch (2.54-cm) pieces</li>

               <li>1 tablespoon (15 ml) canola oil</li>

               <li>12 ounces (340 g) asparagus, trimmed and thinly sliced on an angle</li>

               <li>1 teaspoon (5 ml) unseasoned rice vinegar or soy sauce</li>

       <h3>Steps</h3>
       <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl or measuring cup, stir together ¼ (60 ml) cup water with the honey, pepper and ½ (2.5 ml) teaspoon salt; set honey mixture aside.</li>

            <li>In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, turmeric and 1 teaspoon (5 ml) salt. Add the chicken and toss until coated.</li>

            <li>In a medium (10-inch/25-cm) non-stick skillet, heat the oil over medium-high. Add the chicken and cook until the turmeric is fragrant and the chicken is golden brown on both sides, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Add the asparagus, season with salt, stir to combine and cook until crisp-tender, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>

            <li>Add the honey mixture and cook, stirring, until the chicken is cooked through and the sauce has thickened, 2 to 3 minutes.</li>

            <li>Remove from heat and stir in the vinegar, if using. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Serve with lime squeezed over top, if you like. Serves 4.</li>

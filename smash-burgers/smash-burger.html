        <h3>Ingredients for Smash Burger</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ground Beef</li>
            <p>We use 1.5 lbs of 80/20 beef to make 4 double-patty burgers, but you can easily scale the recipe up to feed a crowd (use 3 lbs for 8 double-patty burgers). </p>
            <li>Sauce</li>
            <p>A simple combination of mayo and yellow mustard is what we use to grill and assemble the burgers. </p>
            <li>Cheese</li>
            <p>We love thick-sliced medium cheddar cheese for burgers, but you can use American-style cheese or your favorite sliced cheese. </p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Burger Toppings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Buns</li>
            <p> Brioche buns taste great and have that steakhouse burger look, but any burger bun will work </p>
            <li>Lettuce</li>
            <p>Thinly slice your iceberg lettuce for a restaurant-style smash burger</p>
            <li>Pickles</li>
            <p>Sliced dill pickle chips are the best </p>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <p>Select meaty and large-sized tomatoes for burgers and cut them into rings</p>
            <li>Red onion</li>
            <p>Thinly sliced into rings</p>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare Patties</li>
            <p>Divide 1 1/2 lbs of ground beef into 8 equal portions (3 oz each), cover, and refrigerate until ready to cook.</p>
            
            <li>Make Sauce</li>
            <p>Stir together 1/3 cup mayo and 1 tsp mustard and set aside.</p>
           
            <li>Prep Toppings</li>
            <p>Fully prep your toppings ahead to assemble the burgers right away while the patties are hot and juicy off the grill.</p>
            
            <li>Toast buns</li>
            <p>Lightly butter the cut side of your buns and toast on a griddle or skillet over medium heat until golden brown. Transfer to a rack.</p>
            
            <li>Cook patties</li>
            <p>Increase to medium-high heat. Depending on your surface area, place 2 to 4 cold pieces of meat onto the hot surface. Working quickly, cover each piece with a sheet of parchment paper and smash each into a thin patty. Remove parchment paper, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder, add a dab of sauce, and flip. Sear for 2 minutes on the first side and about a minute on the second side.</p>
            
            <li>Add cheese </li>
            <p>Place a slice of cheese onto half of the patties and top with a second patty and remove from heat. Serve warm over toasted buns with toppings.</p>
        </ol>
